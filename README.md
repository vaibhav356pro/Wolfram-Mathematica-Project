# Wolfram-Mathematica-Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates analytical and computational techniques in mathematical modeling using Wolfram Mathematica. It includes geometric visualization, partial differential equation solutions, and real-world modeling applications.

## 1. Surface of Revolution

-Constructed surfaces generated by revolving curves about an axis  
-Visualized 3D surfaces  
-Computed and plotted level curves corresponding to fixed heights

Concepts used:  
-Parametric equations  
-Multivariable calculus  
-3D plotting and contour analysis

### Surface of Revolution of Parabola $y^2$=4ax  
The surface is obtained by revolving the parabola $y^2$=4ax about the x-axis.  
This generates a three-dimensional surface whose parametric representation is derived using cylindrical symmetry.

The resulting surface is visualized below:

### Surface of Revolution – Torus
The surface shown above is obtained by revolving the parametric curve  
x = 2 + Cos t, y = Sin t,

about the z- axis
This generates a toroidal surface (torus) or a donut like figure, characterized by circular symmetry and a central void. The geometry is visualized using RevolutionPlot3D in Wolfram Mathematica.

### Surface Plot and Level Curves
Function f(x,y) = $x^2$-$y^2$

The function f(x,y) = $x^2$-$y^2$ defines a hyperbolic paraboloid, commonly known as a saddle surface.
The surface exhibits opposite curvature along the x and y directions.

Level curves were obtained by fixing the height z=c, resulting in:

-Hyperbolas for c!=0
-Intersecting straight lines when c=0

The surface and its mesh structure are visualized below:
